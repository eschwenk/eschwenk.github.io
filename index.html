	<p><b>About:</b>  Eric Schwenker obtained Bachelor's degrees in both Materials Science and Music Theory and Composition from Northwestern University in 2013. He is currently a Ph.D. student in Materials Science and Engineering at Northwestern University. His research focus is on using global optimization techniques with image-harvesting frameworks and computer vision tools to (1) accelerate data-driven insight from materials microscopy, (2) and solve nanostructure inverse problems in materials imaging. In addition, he has extensive teaching, software development, and high-performance parallel computing experience. 
<!-- 		In his free time, Eric is an avid folk musician (clawhammer banjo) and music composition enthusiast.   -->
